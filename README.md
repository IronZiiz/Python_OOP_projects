# Python_OOP_projects
This repository gathers projects and practical examples developed during my studies on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The goal is to explore core concepts — such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism — and apply them across different contexts, from introductory exercises to more advanced implementations.
