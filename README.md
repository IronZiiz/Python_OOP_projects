# Python_OOP_projects
This repository gathers projects and practical examples developed during my studies on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The goal is to explore core concepts ‚Äî such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism ‚Äî and apply them across different contexts, from introductory exercises to more advanced implementations. 

## üìÇ Included Projects

### 1. `python_oop_api`

**Description:**
A simple application for **restaurant and menu management**, built using **Object-Oriented Programming principles** in Python.
The script creates a restaurant, adds items to the menu (drinks and dishes), applies discounts, and displays the final menu.

**Key Concepts:**

* Class creation and instantiation (`Restaurante`, `Bebida`, `Prato`)
* Instance methods and code reuse
* Modular organization using packages (`modelos/`)
* Encapsulation and clear separation of responsibilities

---

### 2. `python_crie_sua_primeira_aplicacao`

**Description:**
A **terminal-based interactive application** for **registering and managing restaurants**, structured following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture pattern.
Users can register, list, toggle (open/close), and delete restaurants directly from the console.

**Key Concepts:**

* Application of **OOP and MVC architecture** in Python
* Clear separation between **control, view, and model layers**
* Interactive menu structure with input validation and error handling
* Modularization and software design best practices
* Json database

### 3. `python_aplicando_a_orientacao_a_objetos`

**Description:**
An introductory project demonstrating the use of **classes and objects** in Python to represent restaurants and their ratings.
Includes creating restaurant instances, receiving reviews, and toggling restaurant states (open/closed).

**Key Concepts:**

* Class and method definition
* Object creation and manipulation
* Class methods and handling lists of instances
* A practical introduction to OOP in real-world scenarios

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IronZiiz/Python_OOP_projects.git
```

## üß† Purpose

To progressively explore the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and apply them in practical projects, enhancing both **programming logic** and **code architecture skills**.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Technologies Used
* **Python 3.10+**
* **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** structure
* Best practices PEP8 for modularization and code reuse
